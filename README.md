Test resource to implement custom scenarios, thanks to deterministic_bubble for setting the facts straight on how this is done.

Notes

This has loaded the Triathalon Scenarios and many more on load, the best way so far is to remove all the extra items that are not required to stop them from loading but in turn this removed a lot of other scenarios also. More testing to be looked into.
